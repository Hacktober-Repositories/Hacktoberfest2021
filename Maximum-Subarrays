Problem Statement

Ninjas has been given an array. He wants to find a subarray such that the sum of all elements in the subarray is maximum.
Subarray 'A' is greater than sub-array 'B' if sum(A) > sum(B). If two sub-array have the same maximum sum, then output the subarray that has a larger length.
A subarray means a contiguous part of an array. For example, In 'arr' = [1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2], [2, 3, 4] are the contiguous subarry but [1, 3, 4] is not a subarray.

Note:
More than one sub-array can have a maximum sum, in that case, output any.

Input Format:
The first line contains an integer 'T' which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer ‘N’ denoting the size of the array.
The second line of each test case contains ‘N’ space-separated integers denoting the elements of the array.
