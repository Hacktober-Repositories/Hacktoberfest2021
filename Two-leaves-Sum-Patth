Problem Statement

You are given a non-empty binary tree where each node has a non-negative integer value. Return the maximum possible sum of path between any two leaves of the given tree.
The path is also inclusive of the leaf nodes and the maximum path sum may or may not go through the root of the given tree.
If there is only one leaf node in the tree, then return -1.

Input Format
The first line of input contains an integer 'T' representing the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The only line of each test case contains elements in the level order form. The line consists of values of nodes separated by a single space. In case a node is null, we take -1 on its place.
