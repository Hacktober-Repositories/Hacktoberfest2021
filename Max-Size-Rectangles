Problem Statement
You are given an 'N' * 'M' sized binary-valued matrix 'MAT, where 'N' is the number of rows and 'M' is the number of columns. 
You need to return the maximum size (area) of the submatrix which consists of all 1’s i.e. the maximum area of a submatrix in which each cell has only the value ‘1’.

Note:
1. Binary valued matrix has only two values in each cell : 0 and 1.
2. A submatrix is a matrix formed by selecting certain rows and columns from a larger matrix.
3. The area of a matrix with 'h' rows and 'w' columns is equal to 'h' * 'w'. 

Input Format:
The first line of the input contains an integer 'T' denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers 'N' and 'M', where 'N' = the number of rows in the given matrix and 'M' = the number of columns in the given matrix.
Then 'N' lines follow for each test case. Each line contains 'M' space-separated integers (either 1 or 0) denoting matrix elements.

Output Format:
For each test case print in a single line the area of maximum size submatrix of all 1’s in the given matrix on a new line.
The output of each test case will be printed in a separate line.
Note:
You do not need to print anything, it has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.
